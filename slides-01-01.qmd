# CSc 110 Computer Programming I -- Course Intro

# Let’s Get Seated

This course includes frequent collaborative activities.
Please choose seats at the center tables and leave tables along the walls empty. 
When possible, sit with others rather than alone.

## **Welcome to CSc 110**

-   This is CSc 110, Introduction to Computer Programming I
-   Want to learn how to program? . . . You're in the right class!

## Who am I?

-   Xinchen Yu (you can call me Xinchen or Dr. Yu)
-   Office: Gould-Simpson 829
-   Office hours: Thursday 12:00pm - 2:00pm
    -   Priority window: 12:00pm -  1:00pm

## Who are the teaching assistants? (TAs)

The TAs are responsible for:

-   Helping you on office hours
-   Grading assignments, quizzes, and exams
-   Giving you feedback on grading or your solutions

. . . So get to know them!

## What is this class, anyways?

-   You will learn how to program in Python (version 3)
-   Will cover many of the basic principles and concepts, such as
    -   input/output
    -   conditionals and loops (control flow)
    -   functions and decomposition
    -   data structures and more!
-   Prerequisites: College Algebra or CSc 101 or appropriate math placement score

## In-class activity 1

- 👥 Pair with a partner at your table

- 🔄 Share one thing you're willing to try, fail at, and eventually succeed in

- 💬 Be ready to share your partner's story!


## What do you need to succeed in this class?

A willingness to:

-   be curious about how things work
-   try and fail

## What do you need to succeed in this class?

-   Access to a computer with internet (you can get one from the library). Install Python and an IDE/editor (Visual Studio Code is recommended)
-   Do the readings, come to class (twice a week), lab sessions (once a week), and office hours
-   Do the assignments yourself 


## How is the structure of this class designed to help you succeed?

-   Active learning -- you are expected to engage in the in-class activities
-   Small sequential steps -- each week we build on top of the content of the previous week, make sure you are following along
-   Spaced repetition -- this is not the type of course you can cram for 2 hours before the exam
-   Mastery checks -- frequent assessment

## Assessment structure

-   Programming Problems

-   Short Projects (to be completed in the lab sessions)

-   Projects

-   Weekly Quizzes (on paper)

-   Midterms and Final Exam (on paper)

## Exams and Quizzes

Exams are on paper. Why?

-   Important skill to develop: whiteboard coding interviews are common
-   Gives you the chance to see for yourself what you have or haven’t learned

## In-class activity 2

Course website: [xinchenyu.github.io/csc110](https://xinchenyu.github.io/csc110/)

Access [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1213866), discuss with your group members and work on quiz 01. Answers can be found at:

-   Syllabus
-   TAs and Office Hours
-   Online discussion and office hours

## Other Important Dates

-   Last day for students to add themselves to a course using UAccess is Jan 21
-   Last day for students to drop without a grade of W (withdraw) is Jan 27

## Academic integrity

You yourself do the work.

Examples of breaches of academic integrity:

-   Having a friend do the assignments for you
-   Using generative AI (for example, ChatGPT) solve the assignments for you
-   Copying a solution from the internet
-   Sharing code is cheating

## Materials

-   Readings, videos, exercises, slides, assignment instructions will be available on the website
-   HOWEVER, you are still responsible for things said/announced in class


## How to get help?

**Before you ask for help:** try [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)

## How to get help?

**Before you ask for help:** try [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/). 

Describe the problem aloud, explaining it line-by-line, to a rubber duck or another person (who might not have any experience with programming). This is also a good preparation step to asking other people for help (see next).

## How to get help?

Come to office hours but come prepared!

👍  start early, check typo, rubber duck, provide enough context 

👎  start late, ask vague questions, ask TA to debug for you

-   TAs help answer clarification questions 

-   TAs do not debug for you (you wouldn't learn to solve them yourself if you are always asking other people to do it for you)


## How to get help?

-   Come to office hours!
    -   1 point of extra credit if you show up to office hours (read the syllabus for specifics on this)
-   Ask on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/mk3c0x143v2wf) 
    -   ask on Piazza: questions about in-class activities, assignments, quizzes, and exams (has private options)
    -   email me: only logistics-related questions

# Creating a Supportive Classroom

In this class, I want us to build a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued. That means being thoughtful and respectful toward classmates, TAs, and the instructor. 

# This is a difficult course, but we are here to help you succeed
